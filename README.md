SCXML-XQ
=======
The SCXML-XQ project provides a set of XQuery functions for the interpretation of State Chart XML (SCXML) documents.

The SCXML interpreter implements additional, non-standard features for the automation of multilevel business process models.
In particular, the SCXML intepreter makes available multilevel predicates [1] for synchronization between different levels of a multilevel business artifact (MBA).
The additional features for multilevel business process automation do not adversely affect standard SCXML conformance.
